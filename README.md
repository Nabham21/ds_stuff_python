Just a project I have worked on with csv file.

The CSV file contained a list of random hotels form random states. 
I have performed certain operations on the hotel ratings and pricing by selection of particular states.
The program asks the user for some inputs and according to his needs gives him back the analysis, average some other mathematical operations performed on certain lables to the user. 

Learning outcome was: 
-> Learned to read, write, do mathematical operations on the csv file without using any other modules such as pandas or numpy. 
-> Simple plain program using csv module.
